Community Food Resource Locator App


Problem:  With an epidemic raging across our country many people have found themselves facing food insecurity.  Although this is not a new need, there has been in influx of people looking for help for their families, as well as an influx of organizations and people stepping up to meet the need.
Solution:  With the myriad of resources; public, governmental, private, community based, I would like to create an app to help people find these resources and their details.
    A User will create an account, and log in.  The user can browse several categories of food resources, they will also be able to search by location, dates, days of the week, types of resources or services offered, or by agency.


Future Versions:

â€¢	Get updates from local resources, news, events
volunteer search opportunities
