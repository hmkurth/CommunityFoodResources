Individual Project
Overview
The Individual Enterprise Java Project is designed to facilitate a student’s transition from Madison College to an industry career though the development of a high-quality software product. The project will encourage students to think critically and solve challenging problems while developing skills critical to a successful career in Information Technology. Upon completion, this project will be an important part of the student’s portfolio to be shared with potential employers.

Objectives
Create an innovative, data-driven Java web site or application that solves a problem of interest to the student.
Demonstrate effective use of the technologies and techniques learned in the program, with emphasis on Enterprise Java topics including
Security. At minimum, register a new user and log into the application.
Logging
Unit testing
Java frameworks/libraries (Hibernate)
Web service/s (at least one) consumed using Java
Database accessed using Java
Demonstrate proper use of UI elements to create a visually pleasing, responsive application.
Create a well-structured Java project.
Use version control.
Demonstrate the ability to effectively plan project work and execute that plan.
Document the process and progress of the project.
Articulate the application architecture and explain the technologies used.
Deliverables
Problem statement, user stories, and project plan (detailed schedule for your project). Must be approved by instructor.
Screen design and application flow.
Complete at least 2 design/code reviews with at least 2 peers and the instructor.
Regular (minimum of weekly) reflection statement documenting progress and time spent on the project and course work.
Source code, HTML JavaDoc and all supporting materials, e.g., design documents, published on GitHub.
Deploy the application to a publicly accessible location, i.e., host on AWS.
Present completed project to the class. Demonstrate the application, explain the application architecture and discuss significant technical aspects of the project with emphasis on your independent research technology.
Video demonstration of the completed application - a link to the publicly accessible video in your project readme.md in GitHub.
Checkpoints
(10 pts each)

Checkpoint 1: Problem statement, user stories, project plan, screen design and reflection statements pushed to GitHub. Be sure to identify which stories are part of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Link to your repository here. Due during Week 4.
Checkpoint 2: Database designed and created, at least one DAO with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) implemented with Hibernate, DAO is fully unit tested, Log4J is implemented (no System.out.printlns). Due during Week 7.
Checkpoint 3: Deployed to AWS, at least one JSP that displays data from the database is implemented, authentication implemented (log in capability). Due during Week 9.
